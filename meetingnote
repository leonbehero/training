Supervisor: Welcome to this investigation meeting. We have concern about your recent performance and your reaction and attitude during the meeting with Paula. We want to hereby to listen to your explanation and views.

We started from your discussion during the meeting with Paula. You transferred an Chinese speaking Spanish customer to Spanish team. Paula gave you some feedback. You seems very emotional during the meeting. What do you feel about the feedback and Why were you so emotional during the meeting？

Advisor: There’s many way to resolve customer’s issue. The customer has told me he can speak Spanish.

Supervisor: The customer’s preferred language is Chinese. According to customer service best practice, we need to access customer’s account and provide our service in customer’s preferred language. Did you access the account to check the language preference?

Advisor: I didn’t remember. 

Supervisor: you didn’t access the account. And Paula pointed this out during the meeting. 

Advisor: does it affect the resolution of the customer’s query?

Supervisor: Yes. You didn’t access the customer’s account to check member notes, and to check account status and the language preference. It’s not in line with the best practice. 

Advisor: it’s not fair to me. You have prepared the meeting for few weeks, but you didn’t give me anytime to prepare. I would like you to reschedule the meeting.

Supervisor: I can give you the chat ID and would you please review the chat now?

Advisor: I need some time to prepare.

Supervisor: It’s not a long chat. Could you please review the chat now?

Advisor: it’s not fair. I need some time to prepare. Could you reschedule the meeting.

Supervisor：Ok. I will send you the chat and meeting notes to you. You take some time to review. I will book a new meeting.

Advisor: Ok.
